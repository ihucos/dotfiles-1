Dotfiles
========

This folder, stored as a git repo, contains all the configuration files
I regularly use for command-line apps.

Installation
------------

- Clone the repo from Github into a hidden folder named .dotfiles:
    - `cd ~`
    - `git clone git@github.com:akosmasoftware/dotfiles.git .dotfiles`
- Run the install.sh folder to create symlinks:
    - `.dotfiles/install.sh`
- Boum! You have configured a new computer with your preferred defaults.

Requirements
------------

This installation provides defaults for:

- tcsh
- bash
- vim + MacVim + Janus
