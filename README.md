Dotfiles
========

This folder, stored as a git repo, contains all the configuration files
I regularly use for command-line apps.

Installation
------------

- Clone the repo from Github into a hidden folder named .dotfiles
- Run the install.sh folder to create symlinks
- Boum! You have configured a new computer.
